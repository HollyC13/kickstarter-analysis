# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise, who has previously launched a Kickstarter for her own play, would like to know how different Kickstarter campaigns performed
towards their fundraising goals relative to the dates on which the campaigns launched.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The data shows most theater campaigns are launched in the months of May, June and July.  These three months also account for the highest
numbers of succesful theater campaigns with 67%, 63%, and 65% of these campaigns being successful respectively.  December has both fewer
total theater campaigns launched and the highest percentage of failed theater campaigns by month, with 47% of theater campaigns launched
in December failing.

Please see the [Outcomes Based on Launch Date] (https://github.com/HollyC13/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) chart. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The data shows play campaigns with goals of less than $1,000 are most likely to succeed, with 76% reaching successful outcomes, followed
by play campaigns with goals of $1,000 to less than $5,000, with 73% reaching successful outcomes.  Far fewer play campaigns are
launched with	goals of $20,000 or more than with lower goals...this group accounts for only 58 of the 985 total campaigns launched. 
Only 38% of play campaigns with goals of $20,000 or more were successful.

Please see the [Outcomes Based on Goals] 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
As a regular user of Excel, it was challenging for me to stop thinking as a "user" and more as a "coder".  I could have manipulated
the data to obtain the results for which we used COUNTIFS() but it would have taken a ridiculous amount of time.  I need to
continue to focus on making the code and technology do the work for me, rather than manipulating data and formatting to get
results as I have in the past.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	1. Successful theater campaigns are most often launched in the months of May, June and July.
	2. A higher percentage of theater campaigns launched in December fail than those launched in other months.
	
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	1. Play campaigns with goals less than $5,000 are more often successful than play campaigns with goals of $20,000 or more.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	1. Timing of donations is not available, so we are unable to tell how quickly goals are reached or in what months donations are made.
	2. The only demographic information available for those who donate is country.  Additional data would make targeting groups who donate
	    easier.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	1. Percentage of successful campaigns based on goals.
	2. Campaign success/failure based on country.
	3. Success/Failure of "staff picks".
